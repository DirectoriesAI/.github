Hey there 👋 Welcome to Directories.AI's GitHub!

We're an open source project aiming to make directory sites easier to build, customize and deploy 🚀 Our goal is to empower developers and small teams to create beautiful, functional directories without needing advanced coding skills.

Our repo contains various packages to help you get your directory up and running quickly:

📁 Our core directory template - fork it and deploy your own directory to Vercel in minutes!

🧰 Helper packages for listings, authentication, payments and more. Mix and match as you need!

📚 Comprehensive documentation with guides, tutorials and code samples to customize your directory.

💬 Discussion forum to ask questions, propose features and chat about all things directories!

We believe directories should be easy to make and publish openly. So we're building the best open source tools to make that happen ✨
